# Python for optimization in finance
This repo is a part of the project I have done at Panth√©on Sorbonne University Paris 1. The aim of the project is to apply machine learning tool in finance. Using the "trading-data" dataset:
1. I tried estimate $\alpha$ and $\beta$ using the dataset, and then evaluate the probability of a trade for each of the last 200 requests (rows).
2. By considering client ids. Among the 4 clients, there are in fact two types of clients. I tried to propose and code in the
notebook a method that classifies the clients into two relevant groups as far as their behaviour is concerned.
3.  Using the client identity. I tried to propose and code in the notebook a new algorithm to evaluate the probability of a trade for each of the last 200 requests (rows).
